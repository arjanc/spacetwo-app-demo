# Service Role Key Removal

## Overview

We have successfully removed all `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` references from the codebase. The service role key was being used unnecessarily in several places where regular Supabase client authentication would work just as well.

## Why Remove Service Role Key?

1. **Security**: Service role keys bypass all RLS policies, which can be a security risk
2. **Simplicity**: Regular authentication is simpler and more maintainable
3. **Best Practices**: Using service role keys should be reserved for admin operations only
4. **RLS Compliance**: Regular clients respect RLS policies, ensuring proper data access control

## Changes Made

### 1. API Routes Updated

#### `app/api/upload/route.ts`

- ✅ Removed service role client creation
- ✅ Replaced with regular `createClientSupabase()` client
- ✅ All database queries now use authenticated client
- ✅ Storage operations use authenticated client

#### `app/api/files/[fileId]/route.ts`

- ✅ Removed service role client creation
- ✅ Replaced with regular `createClientSupabase()` client
- ✅ File queries and storage operations use authenticated client

#### `app/api/users/create/route.ts`

- ✅ Removed service role client creation
- ✅ Replaced with regular `createClientSupabase()` client
- ✅ User creation now uses authenticated client
- ✅ Removed service role key requirement check

#### `app/api/debug/projects/route.ts`

- ✅ Removed service role key environment check
- ✅ Replaced with regular `createClientSupabase()` client
- ✅ Database queries use authenticated client

### 2. Documentation Updated

#### `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`

- ✅ Removed service role key from environment variables section
- ✅ Updated security considerations
- ✅ Removed references to service role key requirements

#### `supabase/rls-policies-fix.sql`

- ✅ Updated user creation policy to work with authenticated users
- ✅ Removed service role bypass policies
- ✅ Simplified policy to only allow users to create their own records

#### `supabase/rls-policies-projects-fix.sql`

- ✅ Updated project creation policy to work with authenticated users
- ✅ Removed service role bypass policies
- ✅ Simplified policy to only allow users to create their own projects

## Benefits

### Security Improvements

- All operations now respect RLS policies
- No more bypassing of security controls
- Proper user authentication required for all operations

### Simplified Architecture

- Single authentication method across all API routes
- Consistent error handling
- Easier to maintain and debug

### Better Practices

- Follows Supabase best practices
- Proper use of RLS policies
- Reduced attack surface

## Environment Variables

You can now remove the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` from your environment variables:

```bash
# Remove this line from your .env.local file
# SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

## Required Environment Variables

Only these environment variables are needed:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

## Testing

After removing the service role key:

1. **Test Project Creation**: Ensure projects can still be created
2. **Test File Upload**: Ensure file uploads work correctly
3. **Test User Creation**: Ensure user creation works during auth flow
4. **Test File Access**: Ensure file viewing works correctly

## RLS Policies

Make sure your RLS policies are properly configured:

1. **Users Table**: Users can create their own records
2. **Projects Table**: Users can create their own projects
3. **Files Table**: Users can access files they own or have permission for
4. **Collections Table**: Users can access collections in their projects

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues after removing the service role key:

1. **Check RLS Policies**: Ensure policies allow the required operations
2. **Verify Authentication**: Make sure users are properly authenticated
3. **Check Permissions**: Ensure users have the necessary permissions
4. **Review Error Messages**: Look for RLS policy violation errors

## Migration Notes

- All existing functionality should work the same
- No breaking changes to the API
- Better security with the same user experience
- Simplified deployment (fewer environment variables)
